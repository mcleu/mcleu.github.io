I can't believe it's been one year at Stanford already. It's been a crazy year so far. Here is a short update on what I have been up to:

I've joined the Stanford Biomedical Optics group (SBO), led by [Prof. Audrey Bowden-Ellerbee](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/bowdenlab/), where I am working on a project to improve the success rate of pregnancy and birth of in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) procedures. ​Here at SBO​ we've been using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to image and characterize biological samples, such as bladder cancer, skin cancer, and most recently; mouse embryos! We've recently published the research I've been performing this year​, it can be found in the [Journal of Biomedical Optics](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.20.9.096004).

On the class side, I've been focusing on the medical devices and medical robotics side. I'm particular, I'm interested in product design in the minimally invasive procedures. I've been part of an amazing program this year, [Stanford Biodesign](http://biodesign.stanford.edu/), where over the course of the class we went from need finding, all the way up to prototyping. I'm currently in the process of incorporating and fundraising to pursue our project part-time, [Lelantus Medical](www.lelantusmed.com), as we believe there is a market demand for our product. We strongly believe that it offers several advantages over the current standard of care that we are working diligently to prove!. We've recently been admitted to [Cardinal Ventures incubator](http://www.cardinalventures.org/) where we will be spending the next 10 weeks.
