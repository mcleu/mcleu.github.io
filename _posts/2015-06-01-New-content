I will attempt in the upcomming months to augment the content of my website to include more of my outdoor activities. I would like to transition my site into something similar to [Brice Pollock](http://www.bricepollock.com/)‘s web site, which showcases both his personal and professional sides.

Reflecting upon the past 10 months I have spent in California, I have been to and seen many experiences that I would like to document and share with the rest of the world. Stay tuned for upcomming updates on:

*   Yosemite
*   Castle Rock
*   Los Angeles
*   Las Vegas
