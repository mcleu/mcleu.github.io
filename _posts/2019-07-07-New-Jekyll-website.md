Hello world!

It's been a while since we've interacted. I've recently been recreating my website in Jekyll, and it is hosted on [github.io pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Standby as I re-populate my previous posts, as well as start adding and generating new content!

*Please note: I have estimated the publication date of the previous posts as best as I could.*
