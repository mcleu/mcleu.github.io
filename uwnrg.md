# Passivated Anti-Reflective Inexpensive Solution


### Project Directors
Keith Perris (2009-2010), Derek Bennewies (2010-2011), Dusan Sarenac (2011-2013), Ryan Kearns (2013-2014)

### Background
The University of Waterloo NanoRobotics Group (UW_NRG) is an undergraduate student team and research group that utilizes MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) manipulation technology to explore technological marvels at the micro-scale. By encouraging collaboration amongst industrious undergraduate students and supportive professors, the group is able to generate novel ideas that showcase the utility and ingenuity of microrobots.

### About
I am no longer a member of the club. I’ve been involved with the [University of Waterloo NanoRobotics Group(UW_NRG)](http://uwnrg.org/) ever since my first year in university. Over the next 5 years, I’ve held different positions in both the business and technical side of things, as a member, a team leader, and finally as the technical director. I led the team to achieve multiple international victories. It’s a club that I have always been passionate about – working with robots that are smaller than a grain of rice! UW_NRG competes annually in the [Mobile Microrobotics Challenge (MMC)](http://www.uta.edu/ee/ngs/mmc/) hosted at the [International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)](http://icra2014.com/) every year. I wish them many future victories!
