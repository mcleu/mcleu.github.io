Michael Leung has recently completed his Masters in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and is on leave of absence from his PhD in Electrical Engineering. He has recently completed an internship at Apple with the Display Module team, where he worked on the Pro XDR Display. He hopes to one day be able to take a product from concept to the user's hands. His current interests are in the optical hardware space (VR/AR/LIDAR/Imaging), specifically learning about the manufacturing supply chain and product development cycles. His past experiences span imaging devices (cameras), displays, optical coherence tomography (OCT), anti-reflective nano-materials, various modes of medical imaging, and nanomechanical properties.  
As a strategic and conceptual thinker, Michael is able to conduct specialized research, design, and validation tests. He is able to deliver high impact solutions by applying sound technical and analytic judgment. He has co-founded a company and assisted many others seed funded ventures to growth and success. Michael is able to thrive in all environments by adopting and learning quickly and is always welcoming new challenges with an open mind.
